# centurion-ui theme


A theme that very closely resembles the Centurion Sublime Text theme for Atom. All credit for the design inspiration goes to ~[Alan Hortle](https://github.com/allanhortle).

Centurion was "made out of a want for less UI and more code. It's so minimal you can barely see it. No gradients, no 1px edges and not a thousand different icon sprites."

## To Install

`apm install centurion-ui`

Activated by going to the `Themes` section in the Settings view (`cmd + ,`) and selecting it from the
`UI Themes` drop-down menu.
